(Major changes from 20081125)

20130524:
- Added direct support for censoring (univariate only).
- coda support added to grapham_read.r (by Ashley Ford).

20101119:
- Added new adaptation algorithm "ram" ("robust adaptive Metropolis").
- Added a possibility to use different adaptation weight for scaling 
  (para.adapt_weight_sc) and matrix factor (para.adapt_weight) adaptation.
- Possibility to select either random-scan Gibbs sampling by setting 
  "para.random_scan=1". Otherwise, systematic scanning is used.

20090407:
- Redundant computations within delayed rejection omitted.
- Added the possibility to write (binary) adaptation 
  parameters to a file.
- A new Lua script for preprocessing the configuration
  files before they are read in C.

20090219:
- Added more alternative proposal distributions.
- Added new "Rao-Blackwellised" algorithms "rbam" and "rbams".
- The handling of the special case d=1 with algorithm "ams" 
  was changed: now the case d=1 is handled similarly as d>1.
