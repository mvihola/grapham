# Grapham

This is the source code of the Grapham (Graphical models with adaptive random walk Metropolis algorithms), which is directly related to these publications:

* [Comput. Stat. Data An. 54(1), 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2009.09.001) (preprint: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4095)).
* [Statist. Comput. 22(5), 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11222-011-9269-5) (preprint: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4381))

and which implements a number of other adaptive MCMC algorithms as well. See [this page](http://iki.fi/mvihola/grapham/) for more details.

See also the newer [AdaptiveMCMC.jl](https://github.com/mvihola/AdaptiveMCMC.jl) Julia-package which implements partly the same algorithms, in a more modular fashion.
